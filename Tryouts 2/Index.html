    <h1>What Are the Seven Wonders of the World?</h1>
    <p>
      The first
      <span> ‘seven wonders of the ancient world’</span>
      list was made more than 2000 years ago, by adventurous Hellenic travelers
      who marveled at the world’s most incredible man-made constructions. Since
      then, most of the original list have been destroyed, aside from the
      <span>"Great Pyramid of Giza".</span> In 2001, Swiss-born, Canadian
      filmmaker Bernard Weber set up the New7Wonders Foundation to find a new
      seven wonders of the world for the modern era, asking members of the
      public to cast their votes. After months of deliberating, debating and
      shortlists, these are the impressive feats that made the final cut.

      <p><b>Let's see about:</b></p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>The Colosseum, Rome, Italy</li>
        <li>The Great Wall of China</li>
        <li>The Taj Mahal, India</li>
        <li>Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</li>
        <li>Machu Picchu, Peru</li>

        <li>Petra, Jordan</li>

    <h2>1.The Colosseum, Rome, Italy</h2>
    <p>
      The Colosseum is the
      <strong>great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome</strong> where
      gladiators once fought for their life. The largest amphitheater ever
      built, it was constructed from sand and stone over
      <span>eight years, from AD72 to AD80</span>. The colossal structure could
      hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circular ring around the central
      stage. Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took place here, not just
      gladiatorial games, but also Classical plays, animal hunts and executions.
      Some say water was even pumped into the arena to enact mock sea battles.
      Partially damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuries,
      <i><b>the Colosseum is still an iconic memento of Roman history</b></i
      >, visited by thousands of tourists every year, so it stands to reason it
      would make the list of today’s seven wonders of the world.

    <h2>2.The Great Wall of China</h2>
    <p>
      <i>The Great Wall of China</i> is a huge barrier that spans thousands of
      miles along China’s historic northern border. Created over millennia, the
      wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to
      <span> the 7th century BCE </span>, built as protective barriers against
      nomadic raids. In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor
      <strong> Qin Shi Huang </strong> masterminded the unification of all
      China’s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening and extending the
      wall to keep out northern invaders. Today the wall is recognized as one of
      the seven wonders, which, including all its branches,
      <span> measures a whopping 13,171 miles. </span>

    <h2>3.The Taj Mahal, India</h2>
    <p>
      India’s renowned
      <strong>Taj Mahal (Persian for Crown of Palaces)</strong> is the stunning
      white marble mausoleum on the bank of the Yamuna River in the city of
      Agra, and it has been selected as one of the seven wonders of the world.
      <span>
        Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan built the temple as a tomb for his beloved
        wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631.
      </span>
      A marble tomb in the center is surrounded by 42 acres of grounds, where
      gardens, a mosque, guest house and pool complete the complex. The entire
      project took over 22 years to complete by 20,000 workers at a cost of 32
      million rupees <i>(around US$827 million by today’s standards).</i> But
      the hard work paid off – today the Taj Mahal is recognized as a UNESCO
      World Heritage Site, and a vital component of India’s rich Mughal history.

    <h2>4.Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</h2>
    <p>
      The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over
      <span> Rio de Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado </span>. At 30 meters
      tall, this monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. This huge public
      artwork was designed by the
      <i>Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski</i> in the 1920s and completed by
      Brazilian engineer <b>Heitor da Silva Costa</b>, and
      <b>French engineer Albert Caquot in 1931.</b> Made from reinforced
      concrete clad in over 6 million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer is
      the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Built just after the end of
      the First World War, the sculpture was an overpowering symbol of
      Christianity and hope when the world had been brought to its knees, so its
      no surprise that this monument made the list for today’s seven wonders.

    <h2>5.Machu Picchu, Peru</h2>
    <p>
      Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the <span>15th century</span>, a rare
      citadel discovered high in the Andes mountains above the Peruvian Sacred
      Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins found
      nearly intact, featuring evidence of former plazas, temples, agricultural
      terraces and homes. Archaeologists believe the citadel was built as an
      estate for
      <span>
        "the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 in polished drystone walls".
      </span>
      The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for
      millennia, before being brought to public attention by American historian
      Hiram Bingham in 1911. Because of this remarkable preservation, it is
      recognized today as one of the seven wonders.

    <h2>6.Chichén Itzá, Mexico</h2>
    <p>
      Deep in the Mexican state of <span>Yucatán lies Chichen Itza</span>, a
      historic Mayan city built between the 9th and 12th centuries. Constructed
      by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itzá, the city includes a series of
      monuments and temples. The most celebrated is El Castillo, also known as
      <strong> the Temple of Kukulcan </strong>. It is a huge step pyramid in
      the center of the city which was built as a devotional temple to the god
      Kukulkan. In total,
      <span>
        the entire temple features 365 steps, one for each day of the year </span
      >. Even more impressively, during the spring and summer equinoxes,
      afternoon sun casts triangular shadows down the pyramid’s north stairway
      that resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface, heading
      towards a stone snake head at the base – no wonder it is one of the seven
      wonders today!

    <h2>7.Petra, Jordan</h2>
    <p>
      Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan is also known as the
      <span> ‘rose city </span>’ for its golden hue. It dates as far back as
      <b>312BC</b>. Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab
      Nabataeans, a sophisticated civilization who carved stunning architecture
      and complex waterways out of surrounding rock faces. The Nabateans also
      established Petra as a successful trade hub, earning vast wealth and a
      booming population before being wiped out by earthquakes. Unknown to the
      Western world for centuries, the city was uncovered in 1812 by Swiss
      explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. 19th century poet and scholar
      <b> John William Burgon </b> described Petra as
      <span>“a rose-red city half as old as time.”</span>
