    <h1 style="color:darkred;">BIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo exhausted all superlatives during his first spell with Manchester United, while he matured from an inexperienced, young winger in 2003 into officially the best footballer on the planet in 2009.</p>
        <p>On the day he departed for Real Madrid in a deal worth £80m - making him the world's most expensive player - his former manager Sir Alex Ferguson said, "Cristiano has been a marvellous player for Manchester United. His contribution has been a major factor in the club’s success in that time and his talent, his ability to entertain and his infectious personality have enthralled fans the world over."</p>
